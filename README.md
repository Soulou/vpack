Vector Pack
===========

This library implements some different heuristic algorithms for vector packing. 

In addition to the author's own implementations (stillwell_current) it also 
contains a problem set generator described in Caprara and Toth 2001, and interfaces
to python libraries based on OpenOpt, Gabay and Zaourar 2013, and Brandao 2013.
